# Compojure

This is a compiler and interpreter for a subset of the C language (called the "E" language in this project, which will hopefully resemble C very closely once I have added all the features!), written in Clojure.

This is an application project for CentraleSupélec's compilation course : the compiler was initially meant to be written in OCaml (based on [this skeleton](https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/cidre-public/compilation/infosec-ecomp)), but I was looking for a cool project to perfect my Clojure skills, so I figured I would just re-write it in Clojure.

## Features

- [x] Lexer and parser (using Instaparse)
- [x] Functioning interpreter, can be used like so :
  ```
  $ lein run "main(a) { return a + 1; }" 4
  >> 5
  ```
